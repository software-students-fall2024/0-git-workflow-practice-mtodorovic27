I find it interesting when the article acknowledges the often strange behavior of these Generative AI. 
The software developing world is running into a new age of programming, companies have put lots of effort in integrating Generative AI. 
As we will have to adapt to this new approach of programming, we will have to catch AI mistakes. But, AI doesn't operate like a human, and will make mistakes that are way off from what we want. 
Tom Tauli, an author of multiple AI books, gives an example of what these mistakes might look like: "For example, you can ask these LLMs [large language models] to create code
and they sometimes make up a framework, or an imaginary library or module, to do what you want it to do." 
It's strange that Generative AI, the new approaches to software development that we are relying on, will make mistakes like this.

**Fatima Villena's comment:**

I agree with the response and am also very intrigued by the newfound nature of AI in modern programming. Not mentioned is that the article starts off quite strong, with a quote from AWS CEO Matt Garman that he "expects most developers will no longer be coding as early as 2026." But the article also explains that perhaps the best usage of AI will be as a tool alongside development, with human supervision.

**Ian Pompliano's comment:**

Generative AI, specifically LLMs, are something I'm really interested in. I do think these strange behaviors are worth learning more about, as they could present many problems in the future. I think it is especially dangerous in fields like media and healthcare, where incorrect information can have really bad consequences.
